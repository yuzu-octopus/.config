Never pipe `curl` into `sh`/`bash` (e.g. `curl https://… | sh` or with `sudo`). That installs system-wide without explicit user permission. Prefer project-scoped or ephemeral installs (`bunx`, `uvx`, `uv run --with`, `brew install` only with explicit approval). Remote-pipe-to-shell is a supply-chain risk and a permission violation; stop and ask first.
